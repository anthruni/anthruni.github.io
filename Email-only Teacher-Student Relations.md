# what if
I'm currently working on a project to reduce latency between what a user *wants* to do, and the layers of software they have to go through to do it. This got me thinking about a more ideal technological solution than my school thought of for online student-teacher relations, Microsoft Teams+Onenote+Word. 

The main draws of this solution are data privacy guarantees, ability to interface with turnitin and other MS365 apps, and Microsoft is funding them so why tf not.


Here is a typical workflow *before*:
Teacher sends out assignment on teams and writes up requirements on onenote, students see the assignment and go to onenote just to see what they have to do, often flipping between random poorly organized pages to see "what did the rubric say about formatting again" and "okay *here*'s the text I'm supposed to reference, better splitscreen as I work. They open up a word document, figure out how exactly their teacher wants it formatted, and only then can they write their paper. If they take a break and their setup is lost, it takes ~2-5 minutes to get ready to actually input text again, or much (inefficient) switching between pages will have to occur. Then they recheck what time exactly it was due in teams (navigation to this is quite painful), and when they're done, they navigate again to the assignment and upload it, either as a link to a onenote page (which takes like a minute to do because microsoft hasnt streamlined this process) or occasionally in a special section of onenote attached as a document printout. Then the teacher can see what all of their students have submitted, and click through and individually grade each one, waiting for MS teams lag in between, sending the grades into *another* app (this is a story for another day, and a spicy one at that ... teaser: my school does class scheduling for 1.4k students *manually*).

Mere standardization of this between teachers will help. A lot. For students. Students clearly have the raw end of the stick here.

Everything would be so much simpler if everyone swiched to specially-configured Thunderbird installs (this would be easy for the schools who are already very chromebook-driven).
