# generic highly useful advice

technology
- bind `ls -tr` to ls if you live in the terminal
- use jupyter notebooks / better REPLs (ie ptpython)
    - `.pythonstartup` with ptpython is good for autoimporting stuff like json and defining helper functions
- tiling window manager is >> the alternatives
- thunderbird
- clipboard manager!! (i like parcellite)

people
- be nice, it literally doesn't cost you anything and is often beneficial/can make you feel good
- reach out to anyone you find interesting and start conversations. even irl, in public
