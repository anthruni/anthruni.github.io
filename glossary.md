# why
putting words to concepts makes it much easier to operate on them collectively and often individually. there are a lot of concepts we don't have words for.
process for generating words: cgpt-4 has a pretty good handle on etymology, so prompts like `create a word whose etymology stems from all+humans+one` work well.

## words
**anthruni/omnianthropunus** - *humanity as one organism*. usage: i cannot wait for omnianthropunus to figure out a theory of everything for physics! distinct from the singularity in that it does not need to be totalizing or tied to technological development, just a view of humanity as a collective consciousness.

**spatiotemporal computing/thought** - instead of or in combination with traditional full res visual/internal monologue thinking, thinking by movement of concepts located in space (ie visualizing a transform, or the shifting of crystals to minimize entropy in some way when trying to solve a physics problem). Distinct from visual thinking in that the concepts are *known* but not rendered fully, and computation is done explicitly by transforms

**nexus** - as the space where the most possibilities are reachable (over time, or space, or another qualifier) - ie the most "general" agent, or the least symmetry-broken state, the most efficient state generator. most things only get close. *optimally* versatile.

- operiotic/functiotic (???) - like semniotic or ontologic but for/relating to operators and funtions instead of the symbols they operate on

## qualia
#### possibly unusual qualia i've had

- Something adjacent to alice in wonderland syndrome, where I can close my eyes and my body feels like it's vibrating and dissassociating, I feel lightheaded and the overwhelming sensation is a slight mechanical "back and forth" and weightlessness
