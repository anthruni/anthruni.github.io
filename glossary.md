# why
putting words to concepts makes it much easier to operate on them collectively and often individually. there are a lot of concepts we don't have words for.
process for generating words: cgpt-4 has a pretty good handle on etymology, so prompts like `create a word whose etymology stems from all+humans+one` work well.

## the glossary
**anthruni/omnianthropunus** - *humanity as one organism*. usage: i cannot wait for omnianthropunus to figure out a theory of everything for physics! distinct from the singularity in that it does not need to be totalizing or tied to technological development, just a view of humanity as a collective consciousness.
