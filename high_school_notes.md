# Before Dropping Out of HS

- have a very specific plan for your time
    - "work on those personal projects"/"actually study <math/physics/etc> doesn't cut it.
        - literally plan out an average day, hour by hour
        - plan out your months as well. explicitly. with some slack ofc but ... do it

## ROUTINE IS IMPORTANT!!!!

- make sure you have basic exercise in, don't sit inside your house all day
    - I am partial to rock climbing, it has kept me sane

- if all of your friends are online, figure out IRL interaction NOW
    - chances are high you'll get depressed not talking to anyone but your family irl
    - meetup/eventbrite occasionally lead to interesting outings
    - so do hobbies (ie sports, competitive games, etc)
    - try to go to hackathons and conferences that are around
    - fly places if you can afford it
    - make new friends

## PEOPLE ARE IMPORTANT!!!!

- in the case that despite doing your best at all of the above, you get depressed or addicted to social media
    - tell someone and have them snap you out
    - use screen time blockers religiously
    - meditate (yes, really)
    - up the amount of time you spend outside of your house or in new situations
    - spend more time with people if possible

- not making enough progress on work?
    - coworking spaces
        - or honestly just go to a library or something. change of pace. figure it out
    - have a *routine* (!!!)

- expect that eating disorder gets more aggressive/develops?
    - spend more time outside of your house when possible
    - therapy??

- do not mess up your sleep schedule.
    - I was sleeping 2-10 and sometimes to 12 because I could now dream for arbitrary periods
        - do not do this
        - sure, consistency is important, but
        - so is circadian rhythm

## BE A PROBLEM SOLVER NOT A PUSSY
#### alternatively, be open with someone else who can do problem solving for you

## Endnote
All in all, I personally would have been *way way way* more miserable in school than out of it, and of these are just pre-emptive warnings, not an attempt to discourage an enterprising high schooler. But like. Think about it, uk?
